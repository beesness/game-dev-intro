### Research inspiring games on itch.io <sup>individual</sup>

What does *inspiring* mean?

Games that catch your attention because of their theme / controls / visual style / gameplay / interface.

On [itch](https://itch.io/) **search** for games that are `Playable in browser` and possibly `local multiplayer` so that they are similar to the game you are building. 

Then **list at least 3** games you found inspiring in [this spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/vg-sheet).

Bonus: explain why they inspire you.

### Prepare your game for playtest <sup>individual</sup>

What changes are you going to make to your game after today's playtest?

Next week we'll have a final round of playtesting in class, before the presentations on Thursday the 14th. 

Bonus: playtest your game with friends/family (you can share the link to `YOUR_USERNAME.itch.io/YOUR_GAME` with them).
