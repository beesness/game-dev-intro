# Introduction to Games Development @ Goldsmiths

## Learning by making mistakes and by making games

During this unit you will undertake a **series of game development projects**. For each project, you **propose** a game that fits its specific brief and then **implement** it. Projects must be appropriate in scope, and pass an approval stage based on a project proposal submission and oral interview. Once projects are approved, you are expected to deliver the proposed game and document it fully. This **documentation** takes the form of images, video, commented source code, executables, websites, and written evaluation, following the method indicated in the project brief.

The first part of the unit will focus on **game design** basic concepts and techniques, which you will practice by making a **board game**. In the second part you will transfer the skills&ideas **from analog to digital** game making. They will create a simple **videogame** using [p5.play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/).
