### Learning by making mistakes and by making games

<!-- During this unit you will undertake a **series of game development projects**. For each project, you **propose** a game that fits its specific brief and then **implement** it. Projects must be appropriate in scope, and pass an approval stage based on a project proposal submission and oral interview. Once projects are approved, you are expected to deliver the proposed game and document it fully. This **documentation** takes the form of images, video, commented source code, executables, websites, and written evaluation, following the method indicated in the project brief. -->

The first part of this course will focus on **game design** basic concepts and techniques, which you will practice by making a **board game**. In the second part you will transfer skills&ideas **from analog to digital** game making. You will create a **videogame** using [p5.play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/).

# Project briefs

### Brief 01

**Prototype a *fundane* boardgame!**

This will be a **team project**.

Your boardgame prototype will be **inspired by everyday life**: take a *mundane* task (like washing the dishes) or an awkward social situation and turn it into a game! 

No monsters, swords, dungeons, spaceships or armies will be tolerated in your game.

Due date: **Thursday, the 2nd of November**

Submission checklist:

- [ ] Game prototype <sup>required</sup>
- [ ] Rulebook <sup>required</sup>
- [ ] VLE group submission <sup>required</sup>
- [ ] Videotutorial <sup>desirable</sup>

All the details [here](levels/04/README.md#finalise-your-game-prototype-and-rulebook-team).

### Brief 02

**Make a videogame with [p5.play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/)!**

This will be a team project.

Your game must adhere to the following **creative constraints**:

1. Every visual element in your game must be represented with **emojis**. Player characters, non-playing characters, walls, obstaclesâ€¦ *everything*. 

	Your can use several emojis for a single object, but only **one emoji at a time**. For example, your player character could have a happy state :grinning: and a sad state :cry: but only one can be experienced by players at any given time.

	You can download **all the emojis** from [this repository](https://github.com/iamcal/emoji-data).
2. Your game must be playable by at least **3 players**.

	Some of them may be eliminated whilst playing. However, there need to be at least three human players to start a game.

Due date: **Thursday, the 14th of December**

<sup>More details to follow.</sup>
