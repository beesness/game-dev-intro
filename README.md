### Learning by making mistakes and by making games

During this unit you will undertake a **series of game development projects**. For each project, you **propose** a game that fits its specific brief and then **implement** it. Projects must be appropriate in scope, and pass an approval stage based on a project proposal submission and oral interview. Once projects are approved, you are expected to deliver the proposed game and document it fully. This **documentation** takes the form of images, video, commented source code, executables, websites, and written evaluation, following the method indicated in the project brief.

The first part of the unit will focus on **game design** basic concepts and techniques, which you will practice by making a **board game**. In the second part you will transfer the skills&ideas **from analog to digital** game making. You will create a simple **videogame** using [p5.play](http://p5play.molleindustria.org/).

### Brief 01

**Prototype a boardgame!**

This will be a team project.

Your boardgame prototype can be about anything. However, you may want to consider the scope of your game, as youâ€™ll have ~ 1 month to prototype and playtest something playable (including the rulebook). 

More details to follow.

### Brief 02

Make a videogame with p5.play!

More details to follow.
